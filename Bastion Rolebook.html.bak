    <p>You may not be the quickest. You may not be the smartest. But you are
      unstoppable.<br>
      As a Bastion, you are a strongpoint in your team’s line. You are able to
      soak up pain and push your advance regardless of whatever stands in your
      way. Bastions are knights, shield mages and warriors, anyone who stands
      their ground using strength, armour or sheer bloody-mindedness.</p>
    <p>You will need to pick a name for your Bastion. Then pick their pronouns.

      hair<br>
